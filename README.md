# React Native Login App
This is a simple React Native login application for learning purpose. I created this app while learning React Native for myself.

These are the tutorials I followed:
UI Design (Part 1): [https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/airbnb-clone-with-react-native-part-1-home-screen-ui-b5ed1c9278ae](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/airbnb-clone-with-react-native-part-1-home-screen-ui-b5ed1c9278ae)
UI Design (Part 2): [https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/airbnb-clone-with-react-native-part-2-login-screen-ui-999773e860e4](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/airbnb-clone-with-react-native-part-2-login-screen-ui-999773e860e4)
For Navigation: [https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)

Right now, the data is static. I created this only to learn about state, props, navigation and UI components, so I did not spend time to make it dynamic.

Try with these credentials:
**email**: hello@example.com
**password**: helloworld

Happy Learning! ðŸ¤“
